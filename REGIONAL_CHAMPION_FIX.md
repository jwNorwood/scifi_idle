# Regional Champion Fix Documentation

## Problem

The Regional Champion encounters were not always appearing as the last encounters before the end node. This was because:

1. The final layer could have 2-4 nodes (based on min_nodes_per_layer and max_nodes_per_layer)
2. Only the first node in the final layer was guaranteed to be a Regional Champion
3. Other nodes in the final layer had only a 25% chance of being Regional Champions
4. Players could reach any of the final layer nodes, potentially missing the Regional Champion

## Solution

Modified `OverworldMapGenerator.gd` to ensure ALL nodes in the final layer are Regional Champions:

**Before (line 107-115):**

```gdscript
if layer == layers:
    # Final layer: make at least one Regional Champion, others can be random
    if node_index == 0:
        encounter_type = "REGIONAL_CHAMPION"  # Guarantee at least one Regional Champion
    else:
        encounter_type = _get_random_encounter_type_for_final_layer()  # 25% chance
```

**After:**

```gdscript
if layer == layers:
    # Final layer: ALL nodes should be Regional Champions to ensure boss encounters
    encounter_type = "REGIONAL_CHAMPION"
```

## Result

Now every encounter in the final layer before the end node is guaranteed to be a Regional Champion, ensuring players always face a boss encounter regardless of which path they take through the final layer.

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Generate several maps in the overworld
2. Navigate to the final layer (layer 5 by default)
3. Every encounter should now be a Regional Champion with gold coloring
4. All final encounters should trigger Regional Champion combat with 5-pet teams
