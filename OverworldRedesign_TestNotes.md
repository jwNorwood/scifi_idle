# Overworld Map Redesign - Test Documentation

## Overview
The overworld map has been completely redesigned to provide consistent spacing and a proper graph structure instead of random node placement.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistent Graph Structure
- **Layered Design**: The map now uses a layered approach with 5 layers by default
- **Consistent Spacing**: Horizontal spacing of 150 pixels, vertical spacing of 120 pixels
- **Controlled Branching**: 2-4 nodes per layer to ensure balanced progression

### 2. Map Generation Features
- **OverworldMapGenerator.gd**: Comprehensive map generation with configurable parameters
- **Guaranteed Connections**: Every node connects forward, ensuring no dead ends
- **Random Variations**: Each playthrough generates a different map layout while maintaining structure

### 3. Integration Benefits
- **Existing Compatibility**: Works with existing Encounter system and combat mechanics
- **Visual Connections**: Line2D paths show clear routes between encounters
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, organized appearance instead of scattered nodes

## Testing the New System

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **OverworldMapGenerator.gd** - Core map generation logic
2. **OverworldManagerIntegrated.gd** - Integrated manager for existing scene structure
3. **Overworld.tscn** - Updated to use new manager

### Quick Test:
1. Open the Overworld scene
2. Run the scene to see the new consistent graph layout
3. Click encounters to verify navigation still works
4. Notice the organized, professional appearance

### Configuration Options:
```gdscript
@export var layers: int = 5                    # Number of vertical layers
@export var min_nodes_per_layer: int = 2       # Minimum encounters per layer
@export var max_nodes_per_layer: int = 4       # Maximum encounters per layer
@export var layer_height: int = 120            # Vertical spacing between layers
@export var horizontal_spacing: int = 150      # Horizontal spacing between nodes
```

## Visual Comparison
- **Before**: Random scattered nodes with inconsistent spacing
- **After**: Organized graph with clear progression paths and consistent spacing

The new system maintains all existing gameplay mechanics while providing a much more professional and navigable overworld experience.
