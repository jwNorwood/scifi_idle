# Overworld Path Overlap Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

Fixed overlapping paths between nodes in the overworld map that made navigation confusing and visually cluttered.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Smart Curved Path System**

- **Before**: Simple straight lines between all connected nodes caused visual overlap
- **After**: Intelligent curved paths that spread out when multiple connections exist

### 2. **Connection Grouping**

- Groups multiple connections from the same node
- Calculates proper spacing and curves for each connection
- Uses Quadratic Bezier curves for smooth, non-overlapping paths

### 3. **Improved Connection Algorithm**

- **Reduced Overlap**: Smarter connection strategy limits additional connections
- **Strategic Distribution**: Better logic for distributing connections across layers
- **Quality over Quantity**: Fewer but clearer connections instead of many overlapping ones

## Technical Features

### **Curved Path Calculation**

```gdscript
# Spreads multiple connections using perpendicular offsets
# Creates smooth Bezier curves for visual clarity
# Automatically adjusts curve intensity based on connection count
```

### **Visual Improvements**

- **Path Styling**: Semi-transparent paths with rounded joints and caps
- **Z-Index Management**: Paths properly layered behind encounters
- **Organized Container**: All paths grouped in a single container for easy management

### **Connection Strategy**

- **Equal/Fewer Nodes**: Direct 1:1 connections when possible
- **More Nodes**: Smart distribution ensuring all nodes remain reachable
- **Limited Additional Connections**: Maximum 1 extra connection per node to reduce overlap

## Usage Instructions

### **Testing the Fix**

1. Run the Overworld scene to see the new curved path system
2. Press **R** key to regenerate the map and test different layouts
3. Notice how multiple connections now curve elegantly instead of overlapping

### **Configuration Options**

- Curve intensity automatically adjusts based on distance and connection count
- Maximum offset limited to 20% of connection distance or 40 pixels
- 40% probability for additional connections (reduced from previous random system)

## Visual Results

- **Clear Navigation**: Easy to follow individual paths between encounters
- **Professional Appearance**: Smooth curves instead of harsh overlapping lines
- **Better Readability**: Each connection is visually distinct and traceable

The overworld map now provides a much cleaner and more professional navigation experience with clearly visible, non-overlapping paths between all encounters!
